At the time of  installation the installer reported intermitant outages which prevented Runabout from syncronising the "completed" job data with ASAP. On 13/1/23, another attempt to sync the job data was made, this time succesfully, which is why ASAP incorrectly recorded the job complete on this date. By default, ASAP uses the "completed" date as the implementation date. \n J209122 - In this job the implementation date should have been recorded as 7/3/2023, as evidence in the evidence documenation supplied. Becuase he was unable to to obtain an electricity bill from the customer on the day of installation, the plumber left the job as "Partially Complete" in Runabout. When he returned to site on the 11/3/2023 he obtained the bill, uploaded a geo-tagged photo of it to Runabout and syned the job with ASAP. ASAP then recorded that the job was "complete" and recorded the 11/3/23 as the Implementation Date. By default, ASAP uses the "completed" date as the implementation date. ELU has coached the installers concerned to ensure that the status of a job in Runabout is showing as "completed" on the Implementation date.
